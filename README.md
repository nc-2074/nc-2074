### About Me  
I am a senior Data Science student with a strong foundation in **big data systems, machine learning, and statistical modeling**. My background in big data and management allows me to bridge the gap between technical analysis and business strategy to solve business problems.

Currently, I am expanding my skills in **big data frameworks and distributed computing** (Hadoop, Spark, Hive, NoSQL databases) while continuing to apply **R and Python** for statistical analysis and machine learning. My goal is to grow a career in **data analytics, advanced analytics, and machine learning**, where I can turn complex data into actionable insights.
